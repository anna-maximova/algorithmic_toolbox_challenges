#Program objective: Given a set of n segments {[a_0, b_0], [a_1, b_1], ..., [a_(n-1), b_(n-1)]}
#with integer coordiantes on a line, find the minimum number m of point such that eahc segment 
#contains at least one point. That is, find a set of integers X of the minimum size such that 
#for any segment [a_i, b_i] there is a point x in X such that a_i <= x <= b_i
